# \`numerical.mle\`: A package for numerically solving maximum likelihood estimators from log-likelihood functions.

The object representing a fitted model is a type of \`mle\` object, the
maximum likelihood estimator of the model with respect to observed data.
We use the R package \`algebraic.mle\` to represent these objects.
