# Grid Search Solver

Creates a solver that evaluates the log-likelihood on a grid of points
and returns the best. Useful for finding good starting points or for
low-dimensional problems.

## Usage

``` r
grid_search(lower, upper, n = 10L)
```

## Arguments

- lower:

  Lower bounds for the grid

- upper:

  Upper bounds for the grid

- n:

  Number of points per dimension (scalar or vector)

## Value

A solver function with signature (problem, theta0, trace) -\> mle_result

## Details

Grid search is deterministic and exhaustive within its bounds. It's most
useful for 1-3 dimensional problems or as the first stage of a
multi-stage strategy (e.g., grid_search

The theta0 argument is ignored; the grid is determined by lower/upper/n.
Points outside the problem's constraint support are skipped.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Simple grid search
solver <- grid_search(lower = c(-10, 0.1), upper = c(10, 5), n = 20)
result <- solver(problem, c(0, 1))

# Coarse-to-fine: grid then gradient
strategy <- grid_search(c(-10, 0.1), c(10, 5), n = 5) %>>% gradient_ascent()
} # }
```
