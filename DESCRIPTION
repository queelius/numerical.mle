Description: Provides composable optimization strategies for maximum likelihood
    estimation (MLE). Solvers are first-class functions that combine via
    sequential chaining, parallel racing, and random restarts. Implements
    gradient ascent, Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton (BFGS), and derivative-free
    methods with support for constrained optimization and tracing. Returns
    'mle' objects compatible with 'algebraic.mle' for downstream analysis.
