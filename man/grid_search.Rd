\title{Grid Search Solver}
\usage{
grid_search(lower, upper, n = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{Lower bounds for the grid}

\item{upper}{Upper bounds for the grid}

\item{n}{Number of points per dimension (scalar or vector)}
}
\value{
A solver function with signature (problem, theta0, trace) -> mle_result
}
\description{
Creates a solver that evaluates the log-likelihood on a grid of points
and returns the best. Useful for finding good starting points or for
low-dimensional problems.
}
\details{
Grid search is deterministic and exhaustive within its bounds. It's most
useful for 1-3 dimensional problems or as the first stage of a multi-stage
strategy (e.g., grid_search %>>% gradient_ascent).

The theta0 argument is ignored; the grid is determined by lower/upper/n.
Points outside the problem's constraint support are skipped.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple grid search
solver <- grid_search(lower = c(-10, 0.1), upper = c(10, 5), n = 20)
result <- solver(problem, c(0, 1))

# Coarse-to-fine: grid then gradient
strategy <- grid_search(c(-10, 0.1), c(10, 5), n = 5) \%>>\% gradient_ascent()
}
