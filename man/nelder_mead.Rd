\title{Nelder-Mead Solver (Derivative-Free)}
\usage{
nelder_mead(max_iter = 500L, tol = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance}
}
\value{
A solver function
}
\description{
Creates a solver using the Nelder-Mead simplex method via \code{optim()}.
This is a derivative-free method useful when gradients are unavailable
or unreliable.
}
\details{
Nelder-Mead doesn't use gradient information, making it robust but
potentially slower. It's useful as a fallback when gradient-based
methods fail, or for problems with non-smooth likelihoods.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use when gradients are problematic
result <- nelder_mead()(problem, c(0, 1))

# Race against gradient methods
strategy <- gradient_ascent() \%|\% nelder_mead()
}
