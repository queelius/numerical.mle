\title{Fisher Scoring Solver}
\usage{
fisher_scoring(
  line_search = TRUE,
  max_iter = 50L,
  tol = 1e-08,
  backtrack_ratio = 0.5,
  min_step = 1e-12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{line_search}{Use backtracking line search for stability}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance (on parameter change)}

\item{backtrack_ratio}{Step size reduction factor for line search}

\item{min_step}{Minimum step size before giving up}
}
\value{
A solver function
}
\description{
Variant of Newton-Raphson that uses the expected Fisher information
instead of the observed Fisher. Can be more stable for some problems.
}
\details{
Fisher scoring is identical to Newton-Raphson when the expected and
observed Fisher information are equal (e.g., exponential families).
For other models, it may have different convergence properties.
